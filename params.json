{"name":"Raqet, Remote Acquisition and Triage","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to the Raqet project.\r\n\r\nThis website documents the Remote Acquisition and Triage tool. This tool allows to triage a disk of a remote computer (client) that is restarted with a purposely built forensic operating system. While performing this investigation a server side sparse evidence file is written. This work process is against most forensic best practices that are documented as most describe investigation starts by making a forensic copy of the full disk.\r\n\r\nThe Raqet project deliberately breaks with this practice. It is the authors opinion that current disk sizes do no longer make it practical nor proportional to always make a full bit-copy. E.g. to save the forensic relevant data of a hacked web server one could argue that the web server log files are sufficient. Especially as most of the web server content is actually from the victim and not from the attacker. \r\n\r\n![Flow of Information](images/FlowOfInformation.png)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\nThe tool is written by the Netherlands Forensic Institute and is available for anyone that is interested. The prime author is R. Schramp (@schramp).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
