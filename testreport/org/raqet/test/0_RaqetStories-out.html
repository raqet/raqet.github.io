Narrative:
In order to inspect the status of the system
As a analyst
I want to check the list of current active clients
Scenario: Check the current registered clients.
Given the acquisition server is running
Given the client is configured for case case1
Given the client is configured for computer computer1
When requesting the list of investigationcases
[{"urlcasename":"defaultcase","casename":"defaultcase"}]
Then the list of investigationcases contains 1 items
{"urlcasename":"defaultcase","casename":"defaultcase"}
And the list of investigationcases contains defaultcase
Given the acquisition server is running
When adding a investigationcase case1
"Success"
Then no error must be given
When requesting the list of investigationcases
[{"urlcasename":"defaultcase","casename":"defaultcase"},{"urlcasename":"case1","casename":"case1"}]
Then the list of investigationcases contains 2 items
{"urlcasename":"defaultcase","casename":"defaultcase"}
{"urlcasename":"case1","casename":"case1"}
And the list of investigationcases contains case1
When requesting the list of computers for investigationcase case1
[]
Then the list of computers is empty
When adding a computer computer1 with clientid testingclient to case1
"Success"
Then no error must be given
When requesting the list of computers for investigationcase case1
[{"urlcomputername":"computer1","computername":"computer1"}]
Then the list of computers contains 1 items
And the list of computers contains computer1
Given the acquisition server is running
When adding a investigationcase case2
And requesting the list of computers for investigationcase case2
[]
Then the list of computers is empty
Given the acquisition server is running
When adding a investigationcase case3
And adding a investigationcase case3
"Failed"
Then the error Failed must be given
When a new client with name testingclient is started
virtualevidence-0000-testingclient_vda.dd
virtualevidence-0001-testingclient_sda.dd
virtualevidence-0003-testingclient_sdb.dd
Then the 3 disks of testingclient are exported on a SMB share within 30 seconds
When requesting the list of active clients as text
Then the list of active clients in html contains testingclient
When requesting the list of active clients as json

Narrative:
In order to read the remote disks
As a analyst
I want to read data from the virual SMB file
Scenario: Client registers with server
Given the acquisition server is running
Given the client is configured for case defaultcase
Given the client is configured for computer testingclient_e31c59cc9c15c72e3f37fb1e31630440
When a new client with name testingclient is started
virtualevidence-0000-testingclient_vda.dd
virtualevidence-0001-testingclient_sda.dd
virtualevidence-0003-testingclient_sdb.dd
Then the 3 disks of testingclient are exported on a SMB share within 30 seconds
Given the acquisition server is running
When parallel reading in 20 threads 19 bytes at offset 101 of disk 0 on client testingclient
Then the read bytes should contain "afbf629c1b776877dec"
When reading 20 bytes at offset 100 of disk 0 on the evidence storage of testingclient
Then the read bytes should contain "5afbf629c1b776877dec"
When reading 15 bytes at offset 65536 of disk 0 on the evidence storage of testingclient
Then the read bytes should be zeros
Given a readable evidence storagebitmap of disk 0 of testingclient
When checking availability of bytes at offset 100 in the evidence storagebitmap
Then the availability status should be true
When checking availability of bytes at offset 65536 in the evidence storagebitmap
Then the availability status should be false
When reading 15 bytes at offset 65536 of disk 0 on client testingclient
Then the read bytes should contain "BLOCK  00000080"
When reading 15 bytes at offset 65536 of disk 0 on the evidence storage of testingclient
Then the read bytes should contain "BLOCK  00000080"
Given a readable evidence storagebitmap of disk 0 of testingclient
When checking availability of bytes at offset 65536 in the evidence storagebitmap
Then the availability status should be true
When parallel reading in 20 threads 19 bytes at offset 101 of disk 0 on client testingclient
Then the read bytes should contain "afbf629c1b776877dec"
When parallel reading with skips of 65536 in 20 threads 19 bytes at offset 101 of disk 3 on client testingclient
Given a readable evidence storagebitmap of disk 3 of testingclient
When checking availability of bytes from offset 101 until 1245285 in the evidence storagebitmap
Then the availability status should be true

Narrative:
In order to identify new clients
As a server
I want to known when new clients are available
Scenario: Client registers with server
Given the acquisition server is running
Given the client is configured for case defaultcase
Given the client is configured for computer testingclient_e31c59cc9c15c72e3f37fb1e31630440

Then the 3 disks of testingclient are exported on a SMB share within 30 seconds
Given the acquisition server is running
!-- a second registration should not lead to more exported disks --!
When waiting for 30 seconds
virtualevidence-0000-testingclient_vda.dd
virtualevidence-0001-testingclient_sda.dd
virtualevidence-0003-testingclient_sdb.dd
